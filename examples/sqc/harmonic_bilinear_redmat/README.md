* __run.in:__ Input file where user can define specific values for input variables
* __keyword_library.py:__ Module that contains all keywords as well as their default values.
* __hel.in:__ Contains the matrix elements for the system part of the hamiltonian in the diabatic basis
* __continuumsd.in:__ Contains the spectral density that defines the frequency-dependent system-bath coupling strength. Format: First column is frequency, remaining are J(w).
* __couplings.in:__ Determines the number of baths and which states are coupled to each bath.
