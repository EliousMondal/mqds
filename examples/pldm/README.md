# PLDM examples

The current examples consist of:
---------------------------------------

* two-state PLDM reduced density matrix calculation in diabatic basis with harmonic bath and bilinear system-bath coupling
* two-excited-state PLDM absorption spectrum calculation in diabatic basis with harmonic bath and bilinear system-bath coupling

NOTES

* The input file __must__ be processed using `python process_input.py` before running a calculation.
