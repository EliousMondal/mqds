# MQDS

__*A modular quantum dynamics and spectroscopy package*__

#### This package is currently capable of the following calculations:


* __PLDM__ (Partially Linearized Density Matrix) calculation of the __reduced density matrix__ of a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic oscillators.

* __PLDM__ (Partially Linearized Density Matrix) calculation of the __linear optical response function__ for a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic oscillators.

* __TWA__ (Truncated Wigner Approximation) calculation of the __reduced density matrix__ of a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic oscillators. (__currently under construction__)

* __SQC__ (Symmetrical Quasi-Classical) calculation of the __reduced density matrix__ of a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic oscillators.
