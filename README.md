# MQDS

__*A modular quantum dynamics and spectroscopy package*__

This package is currently capable of the following calculations:
----

* PLDM (Partially Linearized Density Matrix) calculation of the reduced density matrix of a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic oscillators.

* PLDM (Partially Linearized Density Matrix) calculation of the __linear optical response function__ for a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic oscillators.

* TWA (Truncated Wigner Approximation) calculation of the reduced density matrix of a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic oscillators. (__currently under construction__)

* SQC (Symmetrical Quasi-Classical) calculation of the reduced density  matrix of a system-bath model where the bath consists of a set of harmonic oscillators.
